class UserRepository(SQLAlchemyRepository):
    """
    Specialized repository for User entity data access operations.

    This class extends the generic SQLAlchemyRepository to provide User-specific
    database operations and queries. It inherits all standard CRUD functionality
    while adding specialized methods for user authentication and management.
    
    The UserRepository serves as the data access layer for all user-related operations,
    abstracting database complexities from the service layer and providing a clean
    interface for user data management.
    
    Features:
    - Inherits full CRUD operations from SQLAlchemyRepository
    - Email-based user lookup for authentication
    - ID-based user retrieval for authorization
    - Transaction safety and error handling
    - SQLAlchemy ORM integration for type safety
    
    Usage:
    - User authentication flows (login, password verification)
    - User profile management (CRUD operations)
    - Admin user management operations
    - Email uniqueness validation
    
    Database Table:
    - Operates on the 'users' table through the User SQLAlchemy model
    - Leverages unique email constraint for efficient lookups
    - Supports all User model relationships (owned_places, reviews)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the UserRepository with the User model.
        
        Sets up the repository to work specifically with User entities by passing
        the User model class to the parent SQLAlchemyRepository constructor.
        This establishes the connection between this repository and the users table.
        
        The initialization automatically configures:
        - SQLAlchemy session management
        - User model-specific query methods
        - Transaction handling for user operations
        - Error handling and rollback mechanisms
        """
        # Call parent constructor with User model to establish database connection
        super().__init__(User)

    def get_user_by_email(self, email):
        """
        Retrieve a user by their email address.

        This method is essential for authentication flows where users log in with
        their email address. It leverages SQLAlchemy's filter_by method to perform
        an exact match query on the email field, which is indexed for performance.
        
        The email field has a unique constraint in the database, so this method
        will return at most one user record. The method is commonly used during:
        - User login authentication
        - Password reset flows
        - Email uniqueness validation
        - User profile lookups

        Args:
            email (str): The user's email address to search for
                        Should be normalized (lowercase, trimmed) before calling
                        
        Returns:
            User or None: The User model instance if found, None if no user exists
                         with the specified email address
                         
        Performance Notes:
            - Uses database index on email field for O(log n) lookup time
            - Benefits from SQLAlchemy's first-level cache for repeated queries
            - Returns immediately after finding first match due to unique constraint
            
        Example:
            user = user_repository.get_user_by_email("john.doe@example.com")
            if user and user.verify_password(password):
                # User authenticated successfully
                pass
        """
        # Query User table filtering by email field, return first match or None
        return self.model.query.filter_by(email=email).first()

    def get_user_by_id(self, user_id):
        """
        Retrieve a user by their unique identifier.
        
        This method provides ID-based user lookup, which is the most efficient way
        to retrieve user records when the primary key is known. It's commonly used
        for authorization checks and user profile operations.
        
        This method essentially wraps the inherited get() method but provides a more
        descriptive name for user-specific operations, improving code readability
        and intent clarity in the service layer.

        Args:
            user_id (str): The unique UUID identifier of the user
                          
        Returns:
            User or None: The User model instance if found, None if no user exists
                         with the specified ID
                         
        Performance Notes:
            - Uses primary key lookup for O(1) access time
            - Leverages SQLAlchemy's identity map for optimal caching
            - Most efficient method for user retrieval when ID is available
            
        Example:
            user = user_repository.get_user_by_id("12345-67890-abcdef")
            if user:
                # Proceed with user-specific operations
                pass
        """
        # Delegate to parent class get() method for primary key lookup
        return self.model.query.get(user_id)
